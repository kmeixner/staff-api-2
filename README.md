## Staff Schedule App ##

* This is a react scheduler application given to me as an assignment for a job application. 
* It is implemented using React, Fastify and MongoDb

**Installation Instructions:**

* Install NodeJS on your computer (so that you have access to npm)
* Install MongoDB on your computer as a service
* Note that you might need to create the C:/data/db/ or /data/db/ directory on your computer for the MongoDB service to run
* create a .env file with the MONGODB_URI set to your MongoDB database (eg: MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/staff_db Where staff_db is the database name )
* Note: That "localhost" might not work depending on your system so 127.0.0.1 might need to be used instead
* From your app directory run: npm install
